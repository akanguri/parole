1) Parole dataset (http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/akanguri/parole/blob/master/Parole%20dataset.nb.html) :
Given a parolee's age, race, sex, state, sentence servered, crime type and number offences committed; can we predict accurately if a parolee is likely to violate his/her parole? We shall build a Logistic Regression model and a Tree model to predict the outcome of a parolee violating a parole given certain predictor variables.
